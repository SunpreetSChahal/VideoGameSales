## Video Game Sales Analysis

Within this notebook I analysed data regarding videogame sales spanning over various platforms, years, regions and more. 
I aimed to present:
- the most popular platforms and fluctuation of games sales over the years.
- the most popular genres per region.
- the most popular games per region.

I used some third-party sources to conduct some analysis, such as; Statista and IGN.

*Compared to previous notebooks, I demonstrated new methods of data visualisation.
